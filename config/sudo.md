### **How to Enable `sudo` on Windows 11 Insider Builds**
1. **Join the Windows Insider Program** (if not already enrolled):
   - Go to **Settings > Windows Update > Windows Insider Program** and link your Microsoft account to receive preview builds.

2. **Update to Build 26052 or later**:
   - Ensure your system is updated to the latest Canary/Dev channel build.

3. **Enable `sudo`**:
   - Open **Settings > System > For Developers**.
   - Toggle on **"Enable sudo"**.
   - Choose your preferred mode:
     - **In a new window**: Opens a new elevated terminal window.
     - **With input closed**: Runs the command directly but hides input (like Linux `sudo`).
     - **Inline**: Runs the command in the same window (similar to Unix systems).

### **How to Use `sudo`**
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and prefix commands with `sudo`:
```powershell
sudo netstat -ab
```
Youâ€™ll see a UAC prompt to confirm elevation. Once approved, the command runs with admin privileges.

---

### **Configuration Options**
Customize `sudo` behavior via **Settings > For Developers** or with these commands:
- **Persist elevation** (skip UAC for future commands):
  ```powershell
  sudo config --enable forceNewWindow
  ```
- **Change mode** (e.g., inline):
  ```powershell
  sudo config --enable inline
  ```

### **Important Notes**
- **Availability**: This is **not yet in the stable/public release** of Windows 11. Itâ€™s rolling out to Insiders first.
- **Security**: Like Linux `sudo`, this bypasses UAC prompts for approved apps. Use cautiously.
- **Linux vs. Windows**: Windows `sudo` is a new feature and may behave slightly differently from Unix-style `sudo`.

If youâ€™re not on an Insider build, youâ€™ll need to wait for the official release (likely later in 2024) or use third-party tools like **gsudo** in the meantime. Let me know if you need help joining the Insider Program! ðŸš€
